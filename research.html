                                            The Coding for Good Service was my first introduction to programming, allowing me to both learn and apply newly developed skills in a meaningful way. In my first year, I focused on building a strong foundation in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS, ensuring that I could leverage this knowledge to contribute to projects that benefit my school and its associated communities. As I progressed, I sought opportunities to apply my coding expertise to real-world problems, leading me to work on a project that combined both software development and hardware integration.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left ml-1">
                                            In my second year, I developed a real-time temperature and pH monitoring system for the school’s fish tank. The system was designed to continuously measure and display live data and notify caretakers when the parameters deviated from the optimal range, ensuring a healthier aquatic environment. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left ml-1">
                                            The project utilized an Arduino microcontroller as the central processing unit, interfaced with temperature and pH sensors to capture environmental data. These sensors provided real-time readings, which were processed and displayed on an LCD screen for caretakers to monitor easily.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left ml-1">
                                            To enhance functionality, I integrated a Wi-Fi module, allowing the system to transmit live data to a web-based dashboard. This interface, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabled remote monitoring of the fish tank’s conditions. The backend, developed in Python and Flask, handled data logging and generated alerts for caretakers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left ml-1">
                                            This project combined both software and hardware elements, requiring me to apply my knowledge of circuit design, sensor calibration, and real-time data processing. Seeing the system in action—automatically detecting fluctuations and triggering responses— reinforced the practical impact of coding and embedded systems in real-world problem-solving. Through this experience, I not only deepened my understanding of programming and circuitry but also recognized how technology can be leveraged to create tangible improvements within a community.

                                            I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Inspirit AI program, developed by Stanford and MIT graduates, where I delved deep into the field of Machine Learning. This program provided a structured understanding of AI models, their accuracy, limitations, and real-world applications. More than just theory, it was a hands-on experience where I built models and implemented the concepts I had learned.

                                            For my final project, I developed an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that analyzes sentiment in tweets and forecasts stock market movements—predicting whether a stock should be bought, sold, or held based on social media sentiment. The process involved handling massive datasets, optimizing machine learning models, and validating predictions, strengthening my Python proficiency, data analysis skills, and model refinement abilities. More importantly, it deepened my understanding of AI’s intersection with finance, reinforcing my passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful change.

                                        Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved to play a transformative role in finance and economics, with applications ranging from predictive analytics to customer personalization and blockchain technology. This paper explores AI's perceived impact in these areas through a cross-country survey conducted in India, Singapore, Pakistan, and Türkiye, evaluating perceptions of AI's benefits, concerns, and anticipated adoption timeline. Employing Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and country-based analysis, the study reveals significant demographic and regional trends. Results indicate broad optimism toward AI’s potential, with country-specific concerns around job displacement, data privacy, and ethical implications. Findings suggest a need for balanced AI policy frameworks that accommodate rapid adopters and cautious integrators alike. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of AI's evolving role in finance, contributing valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders.
